Basic Data Structures in C

CS 261 Overview:  Abstract Data Types, Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees and Graphs, Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, Storage Management, and Complexity Analysis of Data Structures.

# Folder Overviews:
Binary-Search-Tree: Tree that implements basic BST structure.

DynamicArrayLinkedList-Hashmap: Dynamic array of linked lists to implement Hash table chaining (Map ADT).

DynamicArrayLinkedList-Hashmap-Concordance: Similar to the above version, except these files implement a concordance application meaning it counts the number of times a word occurs in a document and adds it to the hashmap.

DynamicArray-Stack-Bag: Dynamic array used to implement stack and bag ADT

DynamicArray-Stack-PostfixNotation: Validate a string containing {[()]} characters using the stack data structure

Graph-Deque-BFS-DFS: Graph that uses the deque ADT to implement BFS and DFS algorithms. Utilizes automated tests.

Graph-Deque-BFS-DFS-Files: Graph that uses the deque ADT to implement BFS & DFS algorithms. Utilizes files to test.

LinkedList-Deque: Double linked list used to implement deque and bag ADT with 2 sentinels

LinkedList-Deque-CircularList: Circular doubly linked list used to implement deque ADT with 1 sentinel

PriorityQueue-Heap-Heapsort: Dynamic array used to implement a Priority Queue as a Heap ADT and utilizes the BuildHeap/Heapsort algorithm. Binary heap data structure is a complete binary tree in which every node's value is less than or equal to the values of its children. 

PriorityQueue-Heap-TodoList: Same as the above version, except these files implement a priority based todo list application.
